1,Single,Surface Temperature,K,"This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions.",2m_temperature,t2m
2,Single,Downward UV Radiation at the Surface,JM-2,"This parameter is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the Sun that has wavelengths shorter than visible light. Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface.",downward_uv_radiation_at_the_surface,uvb
3,Single,High Vegetation Cover,Dimensionless,"This parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as ""high"". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. ""High vegetation"" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.",high_vegetation_cover,cvh
4,Single,K Index,K,"This parameter is a measure of the potential for a thunderstorm to develop, calculated from the temperature and dew point temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere. The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms. This parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm: <20 K No thunderstorm, 20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms, 26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms, 31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms, >35 K Numerous thunderstorms.",k_index,kx
5,Single,Lake Cover,Dimensionless,"This parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). Values vary between 0: no inland water, and 1: grid box is fully covered with inland water. This parameter is specified from observations and does not vary in time. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies.",lake_cover,cl
6,Single,Lake Depth,m,"This parameter is the mean depth of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). This parameter is specified from in-situ measurements and indirect estimates and does not vary in time. This parameter is defined over the whole globe, even where there is no inland water. Regions without inland water can be masked out by only considering grid points where the lake cover is greater than 0.0. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies.",lake_depth,dl
7,Single,Mean Sea Level Pressure,Pascal,"This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).",mean_sea_level_pressure,msl
8,Single,Model Bathymetry,m,"This parameter is the depth of water from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It is used by the ocean wave model to specify the propagation properties of the different waves that could be present. Note that the ocean wave model grid is too coarse to resolve some small islands and mountains on the bottom of the ocean, but they can have an impact on surface ocean waves. The ocean wave model has been modified to reduce the wave energy flowing around or over features at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.",model_bathymetry,wmb
9,Single,Sea Surface Temperature,k,This parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface.,sea_surface_temperature,sst
10,Single,Soil Type,Dimensionless,"This parameter is the texture (or classification) of soil used by the land surface scheme of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to predict the water holding capacity of soil in soil moisture and runoff calculations. It is derived from the root zone data (30-100 cm below the surface) of the FAO/UNESCO Digital Soil Map of the World, DSMW (FAO, 2003). The seven soil types are: 1: Coarse, 2: Medium, 3: Medium fine, 4: Fine, 5: Very fine, 6: Organic, 7: Tropical organic. A value of 0 indicates a non-land point. This parameter does not vary in time.",soil_type,slt
11,Single,Total Precipitation,m,"This parameter is the accumulated liquid and frozen water, comprising rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box.",total_precipitation,tp
